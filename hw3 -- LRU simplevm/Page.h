///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// A Page is a class that represents a page of memory
// in our simple virtual memory model.
// If a page object exists, then we say that the page is loaded
// into physical memory. When the page object doesn't exist, then its
// data is stored in the swap_file. When we load in a page to
// "physical memory", we are creating the page and we read the page's data
// from the swap file. A page's data in the swap file starts at
// virtual_pno * Page::PAGE_SIZE
//
// This Class manages a page's worth of data
// Users can access or store data, as well as flush the data in the
// page to the specified swap file. A swap file is where exceess virtual
// memory is stored when it can't fit in physical memory.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
class Page {
 public:
  // Constructs a new Page object associated
  // with a swap_file and a virtual page number.
  // The swap file is where we will load in the page
  // contents and flush the page contents. The virtual
  // page number decides where in that file we read
  // and write this page.
  // Passing in an invalid page number is undefined behaviour
  // Note that a Page does not have ownership
  // of the swap_file_, just access to it.
  //
  // Arguments:
  //  - swap_file the swap_file associated with the page
  //  - the virtual page number of our new page
  Page(fstream& swap_file, pno_t virtual_pno);

  // Constructs a new Page object that is a copy of
  // another page object. Both pages will have
  // the same page number and swap_file, but should
  // have independent copies of the page data.
  // 
  // Misc: this means that there could be issues with
  // having the original and copy page having differnt
  // data. This cctor should only really be used
  // in the context of managing pages with something
  // like STL, where the original page used for the cctor
  // will be discarded. In real C++, we would want to
  // use move semantics here.
  //
  // Arguements:
  //   - other: the page we are copying
  Page(const Page& other);

  // Destructor for the page object
  // Cleans up any dynamically allocated data or
  // otherwise allocated resources AND should flush
  // its contents if the page is dirty at time of
  // destruction.

  // Set the current Page object so that is a copy of
  // another page object. Both pages will have

  // This function is not required, but you may add it
  // if it is needed for some of the STL containers
  // you use in PageTable
  //
  // Determines if this page should go before another page if they
  // were in sorted order.

  //   - rhs: the Page we are comparing this to
  //
  // Returns: true iff this page would show up before the other
  // page in sorted order. False otherwise.

  // is not partially on another page.
  // If you are familiar with endianness, it shouldn't be
  // considered for this function.
  //
  // Arguments:

  // is not partially on another page.
  // If you are familiar with endianness, it shouldn't be

  // Arguments:
